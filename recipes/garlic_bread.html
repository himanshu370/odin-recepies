    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Garlic bread is a delicious side dish or appetizer made with sliced bread, butter, garlic, and often parsley. It's crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and bursting with flavor from the garlic and butter. It pairs well with pasta dishes, soups, or simply enjoyed on its own as a snack.</p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 loaf of French or Italian bread (baguette works well)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>  

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
        <li>Prepare the Garlic Butter: In a small bowl, mix together the softened butter, minced garlic, chopped parsley (if using), salt, and pepper until well combined. Adjust seasoning according to your taste.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Bread: Slice the loaf of bread horizontally, creating top and bottom halves. You can also slice it into individual pieces if preferred.</li>
        <li>Spread the Garlic Butter: Spread a generous amount of the garlic butter mixture evenly over the cut sides of the bread.</li>
        <li>Reassemble the Bread: If you sliced the bread into halves, reassemble them, placing the buttered sides together.</li>
        <li>Wrap in Foil: Wrap the loaf or slices of bread in aluminum foil, leaving the top slightly open to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Bake in the Oven: Place the foil-wrapped bread in the preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the bread is heated through and the butter has melted.</li>
        <li>Optional Broiling: For extra crispiness, open the foil and broil the bread for 1-2 minutes, watching closely to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Serve: Once done, remove the garlic bread from the oven. Carefully unwrap the foil, as steam will escape. Slice the bread and serve hot.</li>
        <li>Enjoy: Enjoy your freshly baked garlic bread alongside your favorite dishes or as a tasty snack!</li>
